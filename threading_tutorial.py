    Threading
    ---------
    Threading is a technique that allows multiple threads of execution to run concurrently within a
    single process. Threads are lightweight and share the same memory space. They are useful for performing
    tasks that involve I/O operations or blocking operations (such as waiting for a response from a server)
    where multiple tasks can be executed simultaneously without blocking the main program.
