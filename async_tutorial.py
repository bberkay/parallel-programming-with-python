    Asynchronous
    ------------
    Asynchronous programming, introduced in Python 3.5 with the asyncio module, is a way to
    write concurrent code that can efficiently handle I/O-bound tasks without blocking the
    program's execution. It leverages coroutines and the await keyword to pause and resume
    tasks cooperatively.
