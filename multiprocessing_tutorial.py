    Multiprocessing
    ---------------
    Multiprocessing is a module in Python that allows the execution of multiple processes in parallel.
    Unlike threads, processes run in separate memory spaces, enabling true parallelism on multi-core CPUs.
    Each process has its own Python interpreter and memory, so they can run Python bytecode simultaneously.
